Executive Summary:

This research project aims to address the challenges of integrating wind power into the electrical grid by examining the potential role of gas-fired power generation in enhancing grid flexibility. The study evaluates the availability of domestic natural gas resources and proposes a strategic natural gas power generation policy aligned with future supply projections. It further analyzes the feasibility of gas-fired power generation in improving grid flexibility across three key aspects: peak shaving demand, resource assurance, and technical advantages.

The study identifies three primary barriers hindering the integration of wind power through gas-fired power generation: (1) the absence of a pricing mechanism for natural gas and peak-shaving electricity, (2) inadequate planning for power distribution and operation across different regions, and (3) the competing demands of ensuring a stable gas supply and flexible peak-shaving power generation.

To address these challenges, the research proposes a series of policy recommendations:

1. Establish a fair pricing mechanism for natural gas and peak-shaving electricity.
2. Reduce the cost of gas used for power generation.
3. Implement a proactive tax policy to incentivize investment in gas-fired power generation.
4. Monetize environmental benefits to promote the adoption of renewable energy resources.

These measures are designed to facilitate the integration of wind power into the grid and support the sustainable development of the energy sector.

In conclusion, this research project investigates the potential of gas-fired power generation to improve grid flexibility and enable the integration of wind power into the grid. By addressing the identified barriers and implementing the proposed policy recommendations, the study aims to contribute to the sustainable development of the energy sector and the broader adoption of renewable energy resources. This well-structured and professionally presented research project is suitable for inclusion in a portfolio showcasing expertise in energy policy and grid integration.




Every project has a beautiful feature showcase page.
It's easy to include images in a flexible 3-column grid format.
Make your photos 1/3, 2/3, or full width.

To give your project a background in the portfolio page, just add the img tag to the front matter like so:

    This image can also have a caption. It's like magic.

You can also put regular text between your rows of images.
Say you wanted to write a little bit about your project before you posted the rest of the images.
You describe how you toiled, sweated, *bled* for your project, and then... you reveal its glory in the next row of images.


<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
<div class="caption">
    You can also have artistically styled 2/3 + 1/3 images, like these.
</div>


The code is simple.
Just wrap your images with `<div class="col-sm">` and place them inside `<div class="row">` (read more about the <a href="https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.4/layout/grid/">Bootstrap Grid</a> system).
To make images responsive, add `img-fluid` class to each; for rounded corners and shadows use `rounded` and `z-depth-1` classes.
Here's the code for the last row of images above:

{% raw %}
```html
<div class="row justify-content-sm-center">
    <div class="col-sm-8 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/6.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
    <div class="col-sm-4 mt-3 mt-md-0">
        {% include figure.html path="assets/img/11.jpg" title="example image" class="img-fluid rounded z-depth-1" %}
    </div>
</div>
```
{% endraw %}
