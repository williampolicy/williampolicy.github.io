I am a policy researcher/data scientist with a Ph.D. in Physics, specializing in the energy sector, with over 10 years of experience. I am proficient in Python and SQL, capable of applying machine learning techniques to solve complex problems.

Key Skills:
- Energy Policy Research
- Data Science with a focus on the Energy Sector
- Proficient in Python and SQL
- Experience in Machine Learning, including Deep Learning

I authored "A Study on the Acceptance of Nuclear Energy by the Chinese Public," providing valuable references for energy companies and policy-making. By analyzing social media trends, my projects predict public concerns about energy projects, establishing evaluation and communication mechanisms, ensuring the successful completion and safe operation of projects worth billions.

I participated in international projects such as "China's Revolution in Energy Consumption and Production to 2050." My contributions earned me over eight prestigious awards, including outstanding achievement awards from the National Development and Reform Commission and the National Energy Administration.

Over the past five years, I have honed my skills in AI technologies such as deep learning, driving innovation in the energy sector. I've published articles on neural networks and machine learning algorithms at international conferences and written over 30 data analysis articles.

Throughout my career, I have collaborated with numerous international organizations, national ministries and state-owned enterprises. I actively advocate for empathy and teamwork, contributing to outstanding results in my projects.

During the pandemic, I reviewed and refined my work models, culminating in a presentation at the Harvard International Conference in 2022. I highlighted the linkages between theoretical and practical aspects and clarified the interplay between individual behavior, energy consumption, and decision-making. These insights hold significant potential for driving solutions across the industrial sector.

I acknowledge that most of my achievements have been outside the United States. I am willing to start at a lower level in a new position or explore related fields, eager to gain more practical experience. I am confident in adapting to different work cultures and developing in an environment valuing diversity and empathy.

As an adaptable and knowledgeable professional, I am passionate about the energy sector and eager to contribute to a data science-focused team. My ultimate goal is to become a senior data scientist in the renewable energy field, working towards a better Earth.
