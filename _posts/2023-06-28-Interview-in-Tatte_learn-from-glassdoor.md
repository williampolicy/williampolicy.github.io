# Interview in Tatte_learn from glassdoor

Interview
I applied online and was contacted for an interview. Upon arriving, I realized I already got the job since the interview was just questions about when I could work, my availability, and what to expect.

Interview Questions
Have you ever worked in the food industry?


Interview
Few questions about relevant experience, mainly asked about application of skills and why you’d want to work for Tatte specifically. Was hired on the spot after about 20 minutes of talking about bakeries. I had no previous barista experience but they do paid training.

Interview Questions
How familiar are you with Tatte?



Interview
I heard back within a week and once I arrived to the interview I was asked a few questions about myself and my availability. Really easy and felt welcomed from the start. The interview itself was pretty short, just about 15-20 minutes or less

Interview Questions
What were your first impressions on Tatte?


Interview
Simple questions, the interviewer had a very friendly demeanor, which I appreciated. Average minimum wage job questions asking about past experience and skills that would apply well to position. They were accepting of my relative lack of experience and discussed training processes and what the job would be like on a day to day basis.

Interview
Everyone was pretty hands on with scheduling an interview. Quick responses, a decent line of communication. I guess now with COVID the interview was virtual, and I guess that got in the way of a more thorough and precise line on communication.

Interview
very easy interview process, asks about hobbies and prior food experience. they also want to know what you value about tatte. just be honest and engaging in the interview process

Interview Questions
what do you value most about tatte?



Overall unprofessional, very disorganized. Shady negotiation tactics. Vary vague answers about the position, company culture etc. The narrative was changed 3 times through the process. Clear lack of organization and leadership capacity at the top, "us vs them "mentality.
It's a shame because the brand looks very interesting but with this approach, it will not get far. Needs to do some soul searching, reevaluate goals and objectives and work on the internal culture in order to get on the right track.

Interview
The interview process was much easier than expected, the managers there were very welcoming and easy to talk to, and they offered refreshments while interviewing, which I thought was a nice touch

Interview Questions

Interview Questions
Why Tatte?


what is your availability?
it was in the email... next time read the applications before you bring people in for interviews... LOL



Interview
I had a sit down interview with the director of operations at that time. She was very nice and asked questions about my past experience, education and goals. After that I waited about 3 days until I heard from them.

Interview Questions
She asked me what my goals were professionally.


Interview
Single interview with the general manager. They checked my qualifications and reviewed academic/work experience. Process took a couple days to arrange the interview, then was offered the job after the first interview.

Interview Questions
What is your experience in hospitality?


Interviewed to work as part-time front of house staff and had a terrible experience with the interviewer. Was given a sheet to check my availability, and I checked 9am - 5pm Mon - Friday. But when I gave the sheet to the woman and started the interview, she was very condescending, smiled in a very patronizing way, and asked what I did at 6am that made me not check that box (um, I have a life, and also like sleeping like a normal human being? Did that ever occur to you?) She also sighed dramatically, saying "You really are not very flexible are you? This is not a lot"..

Um excuse me...... I worked full-time in the past and the schedule is 9-5 all week days, I hadn't realized they considered "part-time" availability to be more than full-time, including weekends and mornings starting at 6am and ending at 6pm?

The woman also mentioned at one point in the interview, "You really don't have much experience do you?" although my resume clearly outlines my qualifications, my previous front of house position and multiple full-time research positions. As if those weren't considered "experience" to her. Even if I was given an offer I would NOT work for these rude people with ridiculous expectations, a condescending attitude, and a distorted view of flexibility---- and after reading the reviews of employees, I am not surprised about my experience. Clearly abusive management that wants this job to control your life. Goodbye Tatte and won't be giving you my business again.

Interview
Very simple and straightforward, came and sat down at the location with the manager. The interview was set up by a mutual friend so I definitely had a special privilege, but all other interviews are set up the same way but instead of managers now its one person doing all the hiring.

I filled out paperwork with HR at their main offices in Cambridge and was given my training materials and t shirts.

Application
I applied in-person. The process took 1 day. I interviewed at Tatte Bakery & Cafe

Interview
There wasn't much to it. They seemed super desperate to get anyone into the door. I was desperately thrown pastries on my way out as some sort of a bribe. I took the job because I was just as desperate as they were. What I find funny is that I lasted longer with the company than the Operations Director who hired me and I wasn't even there for a full year.
