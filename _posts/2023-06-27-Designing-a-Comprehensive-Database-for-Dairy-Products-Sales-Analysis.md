#Designing a Comprehensive Database for Dairy Products Sales Analysis


## Background

The dairy industry is a complex sector, and having a proper database design is crucial for understanding sales patterns, supply chain management, and consumer behavior. This blog post aims to present a comprehensive design for a dairy products sales database that takes into account various factors influencing the industry, including consumption patterns of families, detailed dairy product information, supplier data, discount events, holidays, and extreme weather conditions.

## Requirements

The objective was to design a database for a hypothetical dairy company, aiming to assist in understanding sales trends, consumer behaviors, and supply chain dynamics. The database needed to be capable of answering critical questions like:

- How do family consumption patterns change during holidays or extreme weather conditions?
- What are the sales trends for different dairy products?
- How do supplier flexibility and discount events impact sales and inventory?
- How does the timing of holidays influence sales?

## Database Design

To answer these questions, we conceptualized a relational database model with six primary tables and two summary tables.

### Primary Tables

**T1_Family_Consumption**: Each row represents a unique dairy product purchased by a specific family on a certain date, and fields include Family_ID, Product_ID, Date, Price_at_Purchase, Quantity, Is_Holiday, Is_Extreme_Weather, and Is_Discounted.

**T2_Dairy_Products**: Each row represents daily information about a dairy product, and fields include Product_ID, Date, Price, Inventory, and Sales.

**T3_Suppliers**: Each row represents supplier information for a specific dairy product, and fields include Supplier_ID, Product_ID, Supply_Price, and Flexibility.

**T4_Discounts**: Each row signifies whether a specific product has a discount during a specific time period, and fields include Discount_ID, Product_ID, Start_Date, End_Date, and Discount_Rate.

**T5_Holidays**: Each row denotes whether a particular date is a holiday, and fields include Date and Is_Holiday.

**T6_Extreme_Weather**: Each row indicates whether there's extreme weather on a specific date, and fields include Date and Is_Extreme.

### Summary Tables

**T1S_Transactions_Summary**: Each row represents aggregate information about a transaction, and fields include Transaction_ID, Date, Family_ID, Total_Quantity, and Total_Price.

**T4S_Discount_Events_Summary**: Each row signifies overall information about a discount event, and fields include Discount_ID, Start_Date, End_Date, and Total_Products_Discounted.

## Relationships

The primary tables are interconnected through specific fields such as Family_ID, Product_ID, Date, Transaction_ID, and Discount_ID. These connections allow for a comprehensive picture of the dairy sales cycle. The summary tables link to the primary tables through the Transaction_ID and Discount_ID fields, enabling an aggregated view of transaction and discount event details.

## Conclusion

This database design offers a comprehensive approach to understand the sales dynamics in the dairy industry. By amalgamating various factors influencing sales, this design provides valuable insights that can assist in decision-making for the dairy company.
