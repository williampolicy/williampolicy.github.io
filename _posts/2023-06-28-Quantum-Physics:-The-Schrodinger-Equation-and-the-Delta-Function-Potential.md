# Quantum Physics: The Schrodinger Equation and the Delta Function Potential



Quantum physics provides a fascinating perspective on the behaviors of microscopic particles. At the heart of quantum physics lies the Schrödinger equation, a fundamental equation governing these behaviors. In this blog post, we will delve deeper into a simplified version of the Schrödinger equation in one-dimensional space, specifically focusing on the implications of a delta function potential well or barrier on a particle's state.

The time-independent Schrödinger equation in one dimension is typically written as:

```markdown
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} + V(x)\psi(x) = E\psi(x)
```

where `\hbar` is the reduced Planck constant, `m` is the particle's mass, `\psi(x)` is the wave function describing the particle's state at position `x`, `V(x)` is the potential energy function, and `E` is the total energy of the system.

In scenarios where the particle experiences a sudden change in potential, such as an energy barrier or well, the potential energy function `V(x)` is often modeled using a delta function. In this context, `V(x)` is defined as `V(x) = V_0\delta(x)`, where `V_0` is the strength of the potential.

In the presence of a delta function potential, the original Schrödinger equation splits into two independent equations describing the particle's behavior for `x<0` and `x>0`:

For `x<0`:

```markdown
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} = E\psi(x)
```

For `x>0`:

```markdown
-\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}\frac{d^2\psi(x)}{dx^2} = E\psi(x)
```

Even though the Schrödinger equation maintains the same form for `x<0` and `x>0`, the introduction of a delta function potential at `x=0` leads to a discontinuity in the first derivative of the wave function. The discontinuity can be described by:

```markdown
\frac{\hbar^2}{2m}(\psi'(0^+)-\psi'(0^-)) = V_0\psi(0)
```

This example illustrates the use of a delta function to simulate a sudden potential in the context of the Schrödinger equation. By solving the aforementioned equations, we can gain insights into the quantum mechanical behavior of particles in the presence of abrupt potential changes.

Through this deep-dive into the Schrödinger equation and the implications of a delta function potential, we hope to shed some light on the intricacies of quantum physics and inspire further exploration into this fascinating field.
